* Compilers are used to translate programming language source code instructions into the appropriate machine language instructions.

* Compiler may generate warnings or errors. E.g. if you use a variable without initializing it, compiler will produce a warning.

* The error generated when all the parts that make up a program cannot be put together because one or more are missing is called a *linker error*.
