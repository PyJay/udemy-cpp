## Controlling Program Flow

* Sequence
  * Ordering statements sequentially
* Selection
  * Making decisions
* Iteration
  * Looping or repeating
  

With sequence, selection and iteration we can implement any algorithm.

## Selection - Decision Making
* `if` statement
* `if-else` statement
* Nested `if` statement
* `switch` statement
* Conditional operator `?:` - this is an if else statement wrapeed in an operator

## Iteration - looping
* `for` loop
* Range based `for` loop
* `while` loop
* `do-while` loop
* `continue` and `break`
* Infinite `loops`
* Nested `loops` - great for working with multi dimensional structures


## if statement
```cpp
if (expr)
  statement;
```
* If the expression is true then execute the statement
* If the expression is fake then skip the statement

### Block statement
```cpp
{
    // variable declarations
    statement1;
    statement2;
}
```
* Create a block of code by including more than one statement in code block {}
* Blocks can also contain variable declarations
* These variables are visible only within the block - local scope
