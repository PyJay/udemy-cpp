* Arrays are always indexed starting at subscript 0
* `int numbers[10]` is an array that can contain 10 ints
* C++ treats an array name as memory address of the start of the array
* All array elements must be of the same type
* vectors can vary their capacity as the program runs, but arrays are fixed in size
